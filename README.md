# reportportal
A custom web app for created for a company who wanted a way for their Asset Management team to provide reports to Investors. 

In short, the app requires login credentials; managers can organize and upload reports and investors can access reports available to them. A model overview (ReportingPortal_Model.pdf) is provided in the _tmp folder. 

The app was developed with Dreamweaver (initially CS6; modified with CC 2015) in PHP 5+ and MySQL 5.7. A start SQL file (empty_DB.sql) is provided in the _tmp folder to create a new, basic database with a default user/password "admin/admin".
